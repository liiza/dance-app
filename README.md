I got the inspiration for this app when coaching my team at Black Girls Code -hackathon. 
I noticed that during the breaks the girls would play music videos from their laptops and dance along the choreography of the video.
I wanted to build something that would help girls to engage with these exercises, express themselves and share their progress with the community.

The app makes the phone work like Wii -console. Users can record new exercises by holding the phone in their hand and dancing along with their favorite music video.
Once the exercise has been recorded, anyone in the community can dance along with the exercise and will get feedback on how closely their movements matched the original recording. 

This app is still super rough, but POC shows the concept works and I loved to find time to finish this.
I implemented this with Java just because that was something I was familiar with and I wanted to go with native app implementation as the accelerators were in a critical role in the app. However, I'd love to rewrite this with React Native. The backend implementation can be found here https://github.com/liiza/dance-app-backend
